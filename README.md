# FetchRewards-Assessment
Assessment for Fetch Rewards job application. Refer to Readme file to explain what each file does.

I provided the .zip file of the entire project if that is preferred to download and run instead.

The files and descriptions are listed below:
________________________________________________
HelpAdapter.java - initalizes and helps create the objects to display from the json file to assist MainActivity.

MainActivity.java - The logic for how the JSON file is read and displayed to the application.

activity_main.xml - Creates a RecyclerView that the application can load into.

row.xml - How the data from the JSON file is read and displayed.

build.gradle - gradle file to use for loading dependencies.

hiring.json - file provided to me for the assignment.

*DISCLAIMER - I could not successfully do everything from the assessment but displayed the id, listId, and Name to the application. I thank you for your time in reviewing this and appreciate allowing me to take this assessment!

Sincerely,
Kyle Voight
